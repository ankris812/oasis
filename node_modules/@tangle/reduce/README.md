# @tangle/reduce

Takes in a collection of tangle nodes which contain operational transforms,
and reduces them into some final transform(s).

The reduce starts with root node(s) and traverses the tangle graphs,
successively concatenating the transforms in each node until the tip(s)
of the graph are reached, where we return the final state(s)


## Example Usage


```js
//     A       (root node)
//    / \                                       |
//   B   C     (two concurrent nodes)           |  causality
//    \ /                                       v
//     D       (leading tip)

const nodes = [
  {
    key: 'A',
    previous: null,
    title: { set: 'spec gathering' },
    attendees: { mix: 1, luandro: 1 }
  },
  {
    key: 'B',
    previous: ['A'],
    attendees: { luandro: -1, cherese: 1 }
  },
  {
    key: 'C',
    previous: ['A'],
    attendees: { luandro: -1 }
  },
  {
    key: 'D',
    previous: ['B', 'C'],
    title: { set: 'Tangle Spec v1 meeting' },
  },
]
```

```js
const Reduce = require('@tangle/reduce')
const Strategy = require('@tangle/strategy')

const strategy = new Strategy({
  title: require('@tangle/simple-set')(),
  attendees: require('@tangle/overwrite')()
})

const result = new Reduce(strategy, { nodes })
// => {
//   D: {
//     title: { set: 'Tangle Spec v1 meeting' },
//     attendees: { mix: 1. luandro: -2, cherese: 1 }
//   }
// }
```

Here the only key in our result is `D`, as there's only one leading tip.
If we reduced `[A, B, C]` there would be two tips `[B, C]` and an accumulated
transform state for each.

Note you could use `strategy.mapToOutput` to convert this accumulated transformation
into a 'real' state: 

```js
strategy.mapToOutput(result['D'])
// => {
//   title: 'Tangle Spec v1 meeting',
//   attendees: ['cherese', 'mix']
// }
```

## API

### `new Reduce(strategy, opts) => reduce`

Instantiates a new reduce helper

`strategy` *Object* defines how to reduce nodes. Produced by `@tangle/strategy` (version >=2)

`opts` *Object* (optional) is an object which lets you to customise the reduce:
- `opts.nodes` *Array* is a collection of tangle nodes, where each expected to include:
    - `node.key` - a unique identified for the node
    - "backlinks"
      - an Array of keys for nodes which this node extended from (or `null` if it's a root node)
      - default location: `node.previous` (can be over-ridden with `opts.getBacklinks`)
    - "transformation"
      - an object which containing the transformation which the `strategy` describes
      - default location: `node` (can be over-ridden with `opts.getTransformation`)

- `opts.getBacklinks = fn(node): Array`
    - fetch the part of the node which contains the backlinks to the nodes it followed in the tangle
    - default: `node => node.previous`

- `opts.getTransformation = fn(node, distance): Object`
    - fetch the part of the node which contains the transformation
      - `node` - raw node from which you are going to extract a transformation, `T`
      - `distance` - an integer describing how far the node is from the root (this is a monotonically increasing number so a merge nodes distance will always be 1 greater than the maximum of it's backlinks distances)
    - default: `(node, distance) => node`
    - NOTE - the strategy will automatically pick out properties defined in the strategy and ignore all others

- `opts.isValid = fn(context, node): Boolean`
    - determine whether the next node `node` should be included in the tangle
    - `context` is the context in the tangle immediately before `node`, and is an object `{ graph, accT }`
      - `graph` is an instance of `@tangle/graph`, which has a bunch of helper functions for querying the tangle
      - `accT` is the accumulated transform right before `node`
    - NOTE if a node is not valid, all nodes downstream of that node and considered invalid, and will not be included in the reduce 


### `reduce.resolve() => resolvedState`

A getter which accesses the current resolved state for the

_alias: `reduce.state` (a getter)_


### `reduce.addNodes(nodes)`

Register more nodes to include in the reducing.
